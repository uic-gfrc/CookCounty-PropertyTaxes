If ignoring TIFs, the residential share of EAV is:

$$
ResidentrialShare = \frac{TaxableEAV_{residential} - ExemptEAV_{residential}} {TaxableEAV}
$$

$$
ResidentialShare = \frac{1-\lambda}{1-\lambda-\psi}
$$

$$
TaxableBase = AV_{equalized} - TIFincrement - EAV_{exempt} 
$$

$$
TIFincrement = AV_{equalized} - EAV_{frozen}
$$

The aggregate, or composite, tax rate is the sum of the individual taxing agency tax rates, or $\sum(rate_{agency})$, for all taxing agencies that tax a location. Each unique combination of taxing agencies is assigned a tax code by the assessor's office.
