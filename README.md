# Property Taxation in Cook County, Illinois

The documents and [website](https://uic-gfrc.github.io/CookCounty-PropertyTaxes/) in this repository are a work in progress based on property tax data released by the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) and other publicly available data sources. 

Much of the incorporated data and analysis was prepared, in part, for Cook County's Property Tax Working Group. 

All code was created by Alea Wilbur-Mujtaba and Michael Van Hulle, Research Assistants and PhD Candidates in the Department of Public Policy, Management, and Analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago.

This data and analysis accompanies and supplements information in the [Exemption White Paper and Addendum](https://gfrc.uic.edu/our-work/featured-projects/property-taxes-in-cook-county-introduction-to-reform/), available on the Government Finance Research Center's website.

A report on incentive projects will be published soon, but the analysis for tables, figures, and bonus content can be found on the [Website](https://uic-gfrc.github.io/CookCounty-PropertyTaxes/incentive_report_template.html).
